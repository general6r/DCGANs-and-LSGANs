# DCGANs-and-LSGANs
 
In this project, you'll create your own GAN and train it on a simple dataset of cat faces. This project is designed to give you more experience in implementing and training your own model in PyTorch. You'll also learn to better understand GANs. The data you need for this part of the assignment is included in the repository. You need to download the data and unzip it before you run the code.
